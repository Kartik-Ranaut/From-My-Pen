#Blog website
• Developed a full-stack blog application with an admin interface for writ- ing and managing blog posts. The application leverages MongoDB as the backend, Node.js and Express for the server-side logic, and React with Tailwind CSS for the frontend.
• Utilized MongoDB for data storage, implementing efficient data retrieval and indexing for performance optimization.
• Created an admin dashboard allowing authorized users to create, edit, and delete blog posts.
